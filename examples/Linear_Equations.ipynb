We could instead have many right hand sides (a two dimensional array with multiple columns, one for each set of values for which we want to find a solution).  This is handled by `solve`.  Alternatively, we can decompose $\\mathsf{A}$ into pieces that encode the required manipulations using the LU decomposition.  The decomposition only needs to be performed once, it can then be applied whenever needed.  Finally, we saw that for numerical stability we should also pivot the matrix.  LU decomposition with pivoting is provided by `scipy.linalg.lu`."
